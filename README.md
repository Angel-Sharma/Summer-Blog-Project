# Summer-Blog-Project
A simple blog project
Hey so this is my first project a simple blog project i built in a day or two over the summer while i was free, to run the project open up the files and do npm start into a new terminal
then open up a second terminal and run npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
then the project will be up and running.
